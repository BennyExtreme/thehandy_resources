## Scripts
Sites that offer no playback, just the Funscripts  
(Goes hand-in-hand with the [Playback Engines](#playback-engines) section above)
- [EroScripts](https://discuss.eroscripts.com/)
  - Registration required, offers both free and paid scripts. Registration is free. Lots of additional information and potentially other resources.
- [ScriptAxis](https://scriptaxis.com/)
  - Personally, I haven't used this one as much, more thoughts when I do.
- [RealSync](https://realsync.us/)
  - Offers [free](https://realsync.us/collections/free-syncs) and paid Funscripts. Once again, personally I have not used this one as much.
- [Connect My Handy](https://www.connectmyhandy.com/)
  - Features popular previews for scenes released in 2010s. If available, full versions are linked inside the preview.
  - I haven't heard of this one, on my list to check out.

## Tools
- [Handy Feeling: Script Converter](https://playground.handyfeeling.com/scriptconverter/index.html)
  - Used to convert scripts that are too long to handy, I'm not sure how often this is needed now.

## Development Area
- [XToys](https://xtoys.app/)
